This project is a web application that creates an interactive card slider, allowing users to browse through a collection of cards with information about various individuals. The project incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve this card slider functionality. We have provided an optimized version of the code with comments to explain each step.

**HTML File (index.html):**

- The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page, including references to external CSS and JavaScript files, as well as external resources like the Swiper CSS and Font Awesome for icons.
- It defines a container with a header, logo, and a card slider section.
- Inside the card slider section, individual cards are created using the Swiper structure, and each card contains details about an individual, including their image, name, description, and a "Follow" button.

**CSS File (style.css):**

- The CSS file defines styles optimized for the project, including font imports, base styling, and variables for colors and fonts.
- It styles the container, header, logo, heading, and card elements, ensuring a visually appealing layout for the card slider.

**JavaScript File (script.js):**

- The JavaScript file initializes Swiper, a popular slider library, to create the card slider functionality.
- It sets options like loop, space between cards, and navigation controls.
- The code also includes responsive breakpoints for the slider's behavior on different screen sizes.
